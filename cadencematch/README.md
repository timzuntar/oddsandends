In sports involving repetitive motion such as running, cycling or rowing, listening to music with a beat frequency matched to the motions (cadence/strokes per minute) has been shown to improve athletes' results. Programs and apps scouring the web or your music library for music with the desired BPM have been available for a long time, but if your favourite songs don't make the cut and you keep a local database, you can use this barebones utility to convert them to the BPM of your choice. For example, a 130 BPM song you want to use at a cadence of 80 would get sped up by a factor of 1.23 to 160 BPM so it matches in double-time. A 85 BPM song would get slowed down by a factor of 1.06 to 80 BPM.

To avoid severe distortions, you can specify a maximum relative tempo change. Music which doesn't satisfy this constraint will not be converted.
